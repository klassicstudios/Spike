missed_readings_ldescription=<p align\="justify">If you're experiencing missed readings or gaps in Spike, especially during the night, try the following sugestions\:</p><p></p><li>Close or uninstall any app that might be trying to connect to your transmitter, this includes Today Widgets and Apple Watch complications</li><li>\nIf you are using Loop to get readings from Spike, remove the transmitter ID from inside Loop.</li><li>\nClose all unneeded apps from the app switcher at all times to free some memory.</li><li>\nUnpair all unneeded Bluetooth devices in iOS settings, Bluetooth.</li><li>\nDisable Background app refresh from all unneded apps and keep it on for Spike. You can do this in iOS settings, General, Background App Refresh.</li><li>\nBe sure to disable sending analytics to Apple. This can cause additional strain to your iOS, especially during the night, and make iOS throw apps out of memory. You can disable it in iOS Settings, Privacy, Diagnostic & Usage.</li><li>\nIn Spike's settings go to advanced and turn on very aggressive. If that doesn't work try to also enable alternative method.</li><li>\nAt night, disconnect Wi-Fi and just keep the Bluetooth on. Even better, put the phone in Airplane mode and activate Bluetooth.</li><li>\nGo to iOS Settings, General, Reset and Reset Network Settings. After your device reboots, open Spike and wait for a new Bluetooth pairing request.</li><li>\nIf none of the above works for you, leaving Spike open in the foreground at night with the screen dimmed and without locking your device, tends to be sufficient for iOS not to kill Spike from memory. If you go this route, be sure to leave your device charging.</li><p></p>
